# ðŸš€ Push to GitHub - Quick Instructions

Your code is already committed locally! Now push it to GitHub.

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to **https://github.com** and sign in
2. Click the **"+"** icon (top right) â†’ **"New repository"**
3. Repository name: `hd-booking-app` (or your choice)
4. Description: "Full-stack booking application with React, TypeScript, Express, and MongoDB"
5. **Public** or **Private** (your choice)
6. **DO NOT** check "Add a README file" (we already have one)
7. Click **"Create repository"**

## Step 2: Connect and Push

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Run these in PowerShell (replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username):

```powershell
# Add remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME and repository name)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/hd-booking-app.git

# Rename branch to main (if not already)
git branch -M main

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Verify

Go to your GitHub repository URL and verify all files are there.

## Next Steps

After pushing to GitHub:
1. Follow **[DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](./DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)** to deploy to Render/Railway
