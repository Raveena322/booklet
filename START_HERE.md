## What You Need From Atlas

Just one thing: **Connection String**

It looks like:
```
mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

Get it from: Database â†’ Connect â†’ Connect your application

## Troubleshooting

If connection fails:
1. Wait 1-2 minutes after creating user/network access
2. Make sure network access allows 0.0.0.0/0
3. Verify password is correct
4. Check cluster status is "Idle" (green)

Then run `.\auto-setup.ps1` again.

**That's it! Just run `.\auto-setup.ps1` after getting your connection string!**
